"""In-process bridge from a ``drf-mcp-server`` registry to a Pydantic-AI toolset.

Requires the ``django-pydantic-agent[drf-mcp]`` extra. Imported lazily, only when
a drf-mcp server is configured, so the dependency on ``rest_framework_mcp``
stays optional.

The agent acts as the **logged-in user**: every call hands ``request`` and
``request.user`` to drf-mcp's public in-process surface
(:meth:`~rest_framework_mcp.MCPServer.list_tools` /
:meth:`~rest_framework_mcp.MCPServer.acall_tool`, drf-mcp 0.9+), so drf-mcp's own
validation and permission checks apply exactly as they would over HTTP — just
without the network hop, and without reaching into handler internals.

Tool schemas are sourced from drf-mcp's own ``tools/list`` (via ``list_tools``)
rather than re-derived locally, so the in-process bridge advertises the *same*
merged ``inputSchema`` the HTTP transport would — including a selector tool's
filter / ordering / pagination arguments and the ``additionalProperties`` policy,
not just the input serializer's fields.

Error semantics follow the MCP protocol-vs-tool boundary:

- malformed *arguments shape* (JSON-RPC ``-32602``) and tool-level
  ``validation_error`` results → :class:`pydantic_ai.ModelRetry`, so the
  model retries with the field errors instead of the run dying;
- other tool-level failures (``service_error`` / ``not_found`` ``isError``
  results) → returned as the tool's content, model-readable;
- genuine protocol faults (unknown tool, auth, rate limits) → a hard
  ``RuntimeError`` that aborts the run.

    Built per request so the acting user is the current AG-UI user. Tool
    schemas and execution both route through drf-mcp's public in-process
    surface (``MCPServer.list_tools`` / ``acall_tool``), so the advertised
    parameters, serializer validation, and permissions match the HTTP transport
    exactly. Tool definitions carry the default ``kind="function"`` — the
    in-process kind the run loop routes into ``call_tool``, which then emits a
    ``TOOL_CALL_RESULT`` and lets the model continue (an ``external`` tool
    would instead be deferred to the client and never run).

    ``exclude_names`` carries the ``@tool`` registry's names: on a collision
    the registry tool wins (the same rule ``build_tool_catalog`` applies) and
    the drf-mcp twin is skipped — otherwise pydantic-ai raises ``UserError``
    for the duplicate name at run time.

    ``max_retries`` is each tool's retry budget: how many times a
    :class:`pydantic_ai.ModelRetry` (malformed arguments, a service-raised
    validation error) is fed back to the model before the run aborts. Defaults
    to ``1``, matching pydantic-ai's own function-tool default.

        Carries each tool's **destructiveness** onto the def's ``metadata`` so a
        server-side gate (``ToolGuard``) can require approval for mutating
        tools. drf-mcp already derives MCP ``ToolAnnotations`` per tool
        (``readOnlyHint`` true for selectors, false for services) and lets a
