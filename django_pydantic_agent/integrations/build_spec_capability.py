"""Build a Pydantic-AI capability over drf-services specs — no MCP hop.

Requires the ``django-pydantic-agent[spec-tools]`` extra. Imported lazily, only
when spec tools are configured, so the dependency on
``djangorestframework-pydantic-ai`` (and drf-services) stays optional.

Unlike :mod:`~django_pydantic_agent.integrations.drf_mcp`, there is no MCP server in the
path: ``djangorestframework-pydantic-ai``'s ``SpecCapability`` wraps a
``SpecToolset`` that calls the specs in process through drf-services'
transport-neutral surface (`dispatch_spec` + its off-HTTP helpers), enforcing
each spec's ``permission_classes``. The agent acts as the **logged-in AG-UI
user**: the user is bound from ``request`` here (rather than read off
``RunContext.deps``), matching how :class:`DRFMCPToolset` carries the request.

Choosing the *capability* over the bare ``SpecToolset`` is deliberate: the
exposed tool set is byte-identical, but the capability also teaches the model
``SpecToolset``'s conventions (``page`` / ``limit`` / ``order`` on list tools, and
the error contract — an ``{"error": …}`` result is a final answer, a retry
message means fix the argument, a permission error is final) through
``get_instructions()``, which pydantic-ai appends to the system prompt each turn.
