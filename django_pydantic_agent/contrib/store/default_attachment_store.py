    """A ready-to-use model-backed store over :class:`StoredAttachment`.

    The batteries-included durable file store: bytes live in Django ``Storage``
    (filesystem by default, S3/GCS via ``STORAGES``), metadata in a row. Enable
    it by adding ``"django_pydantic_agent.contrib.store"`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``, running
    ``migrate``, and passing an instance to your transport's
    ``attachment_store=`` argument. For a bespoke schema, subclass
    :class:`ModelAttachmentStore`.

    Owner scoping: every query filters by the ``owner_id`` the
    ``ModelAttachmentStore`` base resolves — the authenticated user's pk, or a
    per-browser ``anon:<session_key>`` bucket when
    the store is built with ``allow_anonymous=True`` (otherwise anonymous requests are
    refused rather than sharing one ``""`` bucket) — so one user's id never
    resolves another's file. The unique ``(owner_id, attachment_id)`` constraint
    holds regardless. The public ``attachment_id`` is an opaque UUID, kept
    separate from the storage filename.
