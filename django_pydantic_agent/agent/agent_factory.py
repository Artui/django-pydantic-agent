    """Build a Pydantic-AI ``Agent`` from a registry and an :class:`AgentConfig`.

    Each registry tool is registered as a plain Pydantic-AI tool. When
    ``config.audit_logger`` is set, an :class:`AuditCapability` on the
    ``wrap_tool_execute`` lifecycle hook times and records **every** tool the
    agent runs — registry tools and composed toolsets (drf-mcp / spec /
    attachment / skill tools) alike. Frontend tools declared in the AG-UI
    ``RunAgentInput`` are merged automatically by the adapter and are not
    registered here.

    ``model_settings`` / ``retries`` tune the model; ``toolsets`` and
    ``capabilities`` compose external Pydantic-AI toolsets/capabilities (e.g. an
    MCP-client toolset) alongside the registry tools, so the agent can reach
    beyond the registered set. ``tool_guard``, when enabled, adds a
    :class:`ToolGuard` that flips destructive tools to require approval.

    The agent is typed ``Agent[AgentDeps, ...]``, so a run must be given
    :class:`AgentDeps` (the transport builds one per run and passes ``deps=``).

    Capabilities are composed **order-independently**: each declares its
    position via ``get_ordering`` (audit is outermost, the guard is orthogonal),
    and pydantic-ai's ``CombinedCapability`` topologically sorts them — so the
    list built here needn't be pre-ordered.
