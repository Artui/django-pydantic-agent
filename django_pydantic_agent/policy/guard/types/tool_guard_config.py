    capability on and tunes *which* tools it flips to require human approval.
    **Off by default** (``enabled=False``): the gate never surprises a project
    that hasn't opted in — matching the package's "no server-side gate unless
    asked" posture.

    When ``enabled``, a tool is gated for approval unless its name is in
    ``exempt``, and it is gated when either it is destructive (a registry
    ``@tool(destructive=True)`` or a drf-mcp tool whose ``readOnlyHint`` is
    ``False``) or its name is in ``require_approval``. ``exempt`` wins over
    ``require_approval``.
