class AttachmentStore(Protocol):
    """Pluggable server-side storage for files a user attaches to a conversation.

    Passed to ``AGUIServer(attachment_store=...)``. The package ships a
    no-op default (:class:`~django_pydantic_agent.NullAttachmentStore` — uploads off) and
    an abstract model-backed base
    (:class:`~django_pydantic_agent.ModelAttachmentStore`); the opt-in
    ``django_pydantic_agent.contrib.store`` app provides a ready
    :class:`~django_pydantic_agent.contrib.store.default_attachment_store.DefaultAttachmentStore`
    that keeps bytes in Django ``Storage`` (so S3 etc. come free via
    ``STORAGES``/``DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE``) and metadata in a row.

    Every method is async and **owner-scoped**: a store filters by the acting
    user so one user can never read or delete another's files — the security
    boundary for the whole feature. ``save`` validates nothing about size/type
    itself (the view does, from its config); it just persists the bytes and
    returns a durable :class:`AttachmentRef`. ``open`` returns ``None`` for a
    missing or cross-owner id rather than raising, so callers map it to a 404.

    Unlike conversations there is **no scoped wrapper** for attachments, and none
    is needed: they are id-referenced with no enumeration, and already
    owner-scoped, so two endpoints sharing a store expose nothing across the
    user boundary. Thread *lists* are the case that leaks.
