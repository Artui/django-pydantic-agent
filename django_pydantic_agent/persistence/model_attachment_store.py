class ModelAttachmentStore(ABC):
    """Abstract base for a model-backed (or any sync) ``AttachmentStore``.

    Provides the async wrapping and per-request owner scoping — the same shape as
    :class:`~django_pydantic_agent.ModelConversationStore` — so a subclass implements
    three *synchronous* operations against its own storage (a Django ``Storage``
    for the bytes, a model row for the metadata). Kept model-agnostic on purpose:
    the package ships no concrete model so it forces no migration; the opt-in
    ``django_pydantic_agent.contrib.store`` app supplies one.

    Each ``_save`` / ``_open`` / ``_remove`` receives the resolved ``owner_id``
    (``None`` for anonymous) and must filter by it so files never cross users.

    Example::

        class MyStore(ModelAttachmentStore):
            def _save(self, upload, owner_id):
                row = MyAttachment.objects.create(owner_id=owner_id or "", ...)
                row.file.save(row.attachment_id, upload, save=True)
                return AttachmentRef(id=row.attachment_id, name=..., mime=..., size=...)
            def _open(self, attachment_id, owner_id): ...
            def _remove(self, attachment_id, owner_id): ...
    """

    # Class-level default (an immutable bool, so no shared-mutable hazard) so a
    # subclass that overrides __init__ and forgets super() fails **closed** —
    # refusing anonymous requests — rather than raising AttributeError at
    # request time or, worse, defaulting open.

    def __init__(self, *, allow_anonymous: bool = False) -> None:
        """``allow_anonymous`` governs whether anonymous requests are served.

        ``False`` (the default) refuses them rather than collapsing every
        anonymous visitor into one shared owner bucket, where they could read and
        delete each other's data. It is a *store* policy, so two endpoints
        sharing a store necessarily agree on it.

        This substrate reads no Django settings: pass the value explicitly (a
        transport that exposes an ``ALLOW_ANONYMOUS``-style setting resolves it
        and hands it down).

        A subclass that overrides ``__init__`` must call ``super().__init__()``.
