    """Abstract base for a model-backed (or any sync) ``ConversationStore``.

    Provides the async wrapping and per-request owner scoping; a subclass
    implements the three *synchronous* row operations against its own Django
    model (cross-device, auditable persistence). Kept model-agnostic on purpose
    — the package ships no concrete model so it forces no migration; consumers
    define the model, its fields, and the owner relationship.

    Example::

        class MyStore(ModelConversationStore):
            def _fetch(self, thread_id, owner_id):
                row = MyConversation.objects.filter(
                    thread_id=thread_id, owner_id=owner_id,
                ).first()
                return None if row is None else Conversation(...)

        sharing a store necessarily agree on it.
