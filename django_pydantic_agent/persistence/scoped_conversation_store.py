class ScopedConversationStore:
    """Partition another :class:`ConversationStore` by a scope name.

    Stores key threads by ``(owner_id, thread_id)``. Two AG-UI endpoints sharing
    one store therefore share one user's thread list: a conversation started at
    ``/internal/agent`` appears in ``/public/agent``'s history drawer and can be
    resumed there — under the *public* agent's model, tools and guard policy.

    Wrapping fixes that without a migration::

        internal = AGUIServer(
            registry,
            conversation_store=ScopedConversationStore(store, scope="internal"),
        )
        public = AGUIServer(
            registry,
            conversation_store=ScopedConversationStore(store, scope="public"),
        )

    Prefixing the thread id is deliberate. A ``scope`` column would mean a
    migration *and* a breaking change to the
    :class:`~django_pydantic_agent.persistence.types.conversation_store.ConversationStore`
    protocol — which every custom store implements — for a partition the id space
    already expresses. This composes with any implementation, third-party ones
    included.

    **Opt in explicitly.** :class:`AGUIServer` deliberately does not wrap by
    itself: doing so from its ``namespace`` would silently orphan the whole
    thread history of an existing single-endpoint project the moment it set one.

    The scope is invisible on the wire — thread ids are echoed back to the client
    unchanged; only the storage key carries the prefix.
